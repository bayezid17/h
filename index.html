A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans.Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms fever cough shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

WHO and UNICEF guidelines on infection prevention in schools identify a range of measures that need to be in place for schools to reopen and operate safely daily disinfection and basic drinking water and sanitation services. Yet the latest global estimates found that in the 60 countries identified as having the highest risk of health and humanitarian crisis due to COVID-19 one in two schools lacked basic water and sanitation services and three in four lacked basic handwashing services at the start of the pandemic.</p>
